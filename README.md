# godot-game-demo

Demo repo to build out a basic Godo based 2d tile placement game.

The game is based on a hexagagol grid, with a central reciever section, the game will provide random producer tiles, and transformer tiles to create items to pass through into the main central item.

The central system will accept everything, but will want a specific deliverable which will unlock the next set of producers and consumer.

Tiles can be connected by converyerbelts to transport items from producers through the transformer to the eentral reciever sections.
